Opsiana – Business Analysis Project

-- Project Overview

The Opsiana project was designed to simulate and implement all key Business Analyst (BA) responsibilities in the context of a Fuel Optimization System for Maritime Operations. The objective was to gather requirements, analyze processes, create documentation, and design user interfaces for an end-to-end digital platform that helps vessel operators optimize fuel purchasing and reduce operational costs.

-- Main Objective

To demonstrate core BA competencies, including:
Requirement elicitation and documentation (BRD & FRD)
Process modeling (DFD)
UI/UX prototyping (Wireframes)
Alignment with stakeholders’ business goals and technical feasibility

-- Deliverables in This Project

1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
The BRD captures high-level business needs and project scope.
Key Sections:
Business Objectives: Fuel cost optimization, compliance adherence, real-time decision-making
Stakeholder Analysis: Vessel operators, engineers, suppliers
Scope & Out-of-Scope Items: Defined what features will be part of MVP
High-Level Features: Vessel management, route planning, fuel price comparison, order execution
Assumptions & Constraints: API dependency, data availability

2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
The FRD translates business requirements into detailed functional and non-functional specifications for development.
Key Sections:
System Modules: Authentication, Vessel Selection, Route Management, Fuel Optimization, Order Execution
Use Case Diagrams & Descriptions: Defined user-system interactions
Functional Requirements: Each feature broken down with inputs, processes, and outputs
Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, Security, Reliability
Data Mapping & Validation Rules

3. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
Created Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs to illustrate system processes, data flow, and interactions.
Level 0: Context diagram showing system boundaries and external entities (User & Fuel Supplier API)
Level 1: Detailed breakdown of internal processes (Authentication → Vessel Selection → Route Planning → Fuel Selection → Optimization → Checkout)

4. Wireframes & Prototypes
Designed 7-page wireframe prototype to visualize user interaction flow:
